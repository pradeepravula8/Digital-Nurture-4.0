#  Customer Order Sorting System

This Java project demonstrates how to sort customer orders based on total price using two popular sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort and Quick Sort. It aims to help understand algorithm performance and use cases in e-commerce order prioritization.



# Overview

This program sorts customer orders by total price using two algorithms:
- Bubble Sort: Great for learning, but inefficient.
- Quick Sort: Efficient and widely used in the industry.

Use case: Prioritize high-value orders in an e-commerce warehouse.

##  Features

- Sort customer orders by `totalPrice`
- Demonstrates both Bubble Sort and Quick Sort
- Prints sorted and unsorted lists
- Highlights performance differences with real data

## Technologies Used

- Java SE 8+
- Arrays & OOP
- Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort & Quick Sort)
- Command-line execution


##  Time Complexity Comparison

| Algorithm      | Best Case     | Average Case    | Worst Case     | Space Complexity | Stable |
|----------------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|--------|
| Bubble Sort | O(n)          | O(n²)            | O(n²)           | O(1)             |  Yes |
| Quick Sort | O(n log n)    | O(n log n)       | O(n²)*          | O(log n)         |  No  |


##  Sorting Algorithms

## Bubble Sort
- Swaps adjacent elements until the list is sorted
- Easy to understand but very slow on large data

## Quick Sort
- Uses a pivot to divide the array and recursively sort
- Much faster for medium to large data sets
