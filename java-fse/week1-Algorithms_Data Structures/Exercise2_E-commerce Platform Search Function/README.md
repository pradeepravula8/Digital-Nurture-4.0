#  E-Commerce Search Optimization



This project demonstrates optimized product search functionalities for an e-commerce platform by comparing Linear Search and Binary Search algorithms. It aims to evaluate their performance, usability, and efficiency based on asymptotic analysis (Big O notation).



## üìò Project Overview

E-commerce platforms rely heavily on efficient product searches. In this project:

- We define a `Product` class with searchable attributes.
- Implement two classic search algorithms: Linear Search and Binary Search.
- Analyze each algorithm using best, average, and worst-case scenarios.
- Identify the most suitable algorithm for real-world e-commerce systems based on performance metrics.

## Concepts Covered

## ‚úÖ Asymptotic Notation (Big O)

| Case          | Linear Search | Binary Search |
|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| Best Case     | O(1)          | O(1)           |
| Average Case  | O(n)          | O(log n)       |
| Worst Case    | O(n)          | O(log n)       |

- Big O notation helps estimate how an algorithm scales as the input size increases.
- Binary Search** requires a sorted dataset but provides **logarithmic time complexity**.
- Linear Search is suitable for unsorted or small datasets.
