#  Financial Forecasting Using Recursion

This project implements a financial forecasting tool that predicts future values using recursive algorithms. It explores the benefits and limitations of recursion in modeling growth patterns based on historical data.

---

##  Project Overview

Forecasting is a crucial component in financial planning. This tool uses a recursive model to estimate future values (e.g., revenue, profit, or investment) based on a constant or variable growth rate derived from past trends.

The project includes:

- Recursive computation for future value prediction  
- Optimization using memoization  
- Time complexity analysis  
- Clean implementation in Java

##  What is Recursion?

Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It helps simplify problems that have a repetitive structure.

###  Example

To compute the future value for year `n`:
