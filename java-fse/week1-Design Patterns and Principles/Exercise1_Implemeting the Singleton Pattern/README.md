#  Singleton Pattern Example - Logger Utility


This project demonstrates the **Singleton Design Pattern** in Java using a `Logger` utility class. The singleton ensures that only one instance of the logger is created and shared across the entire application, promoting consistent and centralized logging.



In many real-world applications, it's essential to have a single, shared instance of certain utility classes, such as logging tools. Creating multiple instances may lead to inconsistent logs, file conflicts, or performance issues.

This project solves that by implementing the **Singleton pattern**, which restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object.
