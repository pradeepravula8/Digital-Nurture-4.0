#  Factory Method Pattern Example - Document Management System


This project demonstrates the Factory Method Design Pattern in Java for building a *ocument Management System that can create various document types like Word, PDF, and Excel. The Factory Method pattern provides an elegant way to instantiate objects without exposing the creation logic to the client.




In a document management system, users may need to generate different types of documents. Instead of writing repetitive and tightly-coupled creation logic, the Factory Method Pattern allows us to:

- Define a common document interface
- Implement specific document types (Word, PDF, Excel)
- Use factory classes to create document objects at runtime
